  integer overflow
  numbers are formed basically by nextNumber = currNumber * 10 + nextdigit, so you can check if nextNumber will overflow by checking currNumber and nextDigit
  if currNumber is more than (Interger_max / 10 ), nextNumber will overflow
  if currNumber is equal to (Interger_max / 10 ), nextNumber will overflow if nextdigit is more than 7 (Int max -> 2147483647, divide by 10, rem is 7) 
  for negative numbers, it will be nextdigit < -8
